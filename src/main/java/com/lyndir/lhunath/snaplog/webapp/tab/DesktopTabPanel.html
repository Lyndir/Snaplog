            <p><b>snaplog</b>.net is a home or professional media management and distribution service that gives you the power
            to share the events in your life with the people you find important.</p>
            <p>It's radically different in that it puts you back in control over who is granted access to which of your media.
            After all, it's <i>your</i> media and it's imperative that you have powerful control over how you want to share it.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Host It Anywhere</h3>
        <p>You can host your media wherever it is most convenient for you.  You may already have your pictures in flickr and your movies on YouTube.
        Or perhaps you keep your data on a file server.  You could use the cheap and reliable Amazon S3 cloud.  Or if you prefer to not bother with
        having to upload your stuff manually, just keep it on your laptop or desktop!</p>

        <h3>Organize By What Matters</h3>
        <p>In this digital age it's incredibly easy to take a snapshot or a video.  Instead of coming back from a holiday with three rolls of film,
        we have hundereds of megabytes worth of digitalized memories.  There's no way you can keep track and find the moment you're looking for
        without a solid system for organizing and browsing that mass of multimedia.<br />
        Get to tagging your stuff by the people in it and the events they depicit.  Collaborate by tagging your friends' media and allowing them
        to tag yours.  Link their events with yours and experience your memories from multiple perspectives!</p>

        <h3>Controlled Sharing</h3>
        <p>Went wild at a party and you just have to share it with all your friends?  Great, but perhaps you don't need your relatives to see
        the gory details.<br />
        Looking for the perfect gift for your wife and need her sister's opinion?  Easy, but make sure your wife doesn't happen upon your pictures
        when she decides to relive last holiday.<br />
        Not everything we get up to in life is for the public eye.  Our privacy is important to us, even in the events we share with friends.<br />
        <b>snaplog</b>.net gives you full control over which people can see what events.</p>
