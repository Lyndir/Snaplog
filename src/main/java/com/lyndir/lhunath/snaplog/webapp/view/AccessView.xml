        These controls are used to grant others the rights to view or manage your albums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        It is important to assume the principle of "&lt;dfn&gt;Secure By Default&lt;/dfn&gt;".
        Only grant others the permissions they need when you can trust these won't be abused.
