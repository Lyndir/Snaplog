        Tags are an excellent way to categorize your media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        Assign a tag for every significant element in the picture.
        Make sure to consistently tag these elements in all your other pictures too.
        You will then be able to find all your media which features this element nearly instantly.
